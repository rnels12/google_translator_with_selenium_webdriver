 This is a command-line interface to google-translator. Before it can be used the dependecies must be installed:

`pip3 install -r requirement.txt`

Since at the moment this interface can only be used via firefox, firefox must also be installed. Once all the dependecies are installed, the interface can be run with the following command:

`python main.py --source Dutch --target Thai --words "WORDS YOU WANNA TRANSLATE"`

If you you don't specify the `source` and `target`, they are set to `English` and `German`, respectively.

Enjoy translating!
